At the end of the episode, he gets back in the saddle with one of Summer's high school friends, Tammy. He and Tammy later get married, only for Tammy to reveal herself as a Galactic Federation agent out to kill Birdperson, arrest Rick, and all of his associates. Despite being shot multiple times, Birdperson is soon resurrected by the Federation as the cyborg Phoenixperson in order to serve them. In "Star Mort: Rickturn of the Jerri", Phoenixperson - under the control of the Galactic Federation - comes face to face with Rick, and fights him, almost killing him, before being shut down by Space Beth.
